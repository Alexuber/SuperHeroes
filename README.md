## Installation

To install and set up your "superHeroes" project, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexuber/superHeroes.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd superHeroes
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

5. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can access the application by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure that port 3000 is not being used by any other application. If it is, you can update the `start` script in the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file to use a different port number.

6. You can now begin developing your "superHeroes" application. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

That's it! You have successfully installed and set up your "super-heroes" project. Happy coding!
